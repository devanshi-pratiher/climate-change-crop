# Data-Driven Approach to Evaluate the Impact of Climate Change on Global Crop Production
As global crop production faces increasing strain due to climate change and human-induced challenges, understanding the factors influencing crop output becomes crucial. We study investigating the influence of environmental factors, including the availability of arable land, soil nutrient contents, and exposure to climatic events, on the production of critical crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, and rice. Our hypothesis argues that rising CO2 levels and subsequent global land temperature changes significantly impact the yield of these crops, an understanding of which could guide investors towards properties offering optimal crop yields. <br>
In this research, we conducted a series of experiments to identify the key crop-producing countries, especially those with high CO2 emissions. We then explored correlations between CO2 levels and crop production, temperature, and extreme weather events. Our analytical approach used an XGBoost machine learning model, which yielded an accuracy of around 98% for predicting crop production. Our SHAP analysis indicated that CO2 levels, arable land availability, pesticide use, and nitrogen content are major contributors to crop production. We identified 'golden clusters' of countries, including Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and India, that maintain high production levels of the studied crops despite elevated CO2 levels. Additionally, we have illustrated our methodology by predicting wheat production for India for the next five years. Our findings provide actionable insights for investors aiming to diversify into agricultural real estate. This work provides a roadmap for transforming agricultural investment into a strategy of consistent profitability while contributing to global food security. Future work involves the application of time-series analysis for individual countries to improve the predictive capabilities of our models.
